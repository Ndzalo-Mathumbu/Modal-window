# Modal Window

> A minimalist modal window built from scratch in vanilla JavaScript.  
> I built this as part of learning DOM manipulation and event handling with Jonas Schmedtmann.

## What it does

- Opens a modal when any "Show Modal" button is clicked.
- Closes the modal when:
  - The modal itself is clicked
  - The overlay is clicked
  - The user presses the `Escape` key
- Adds/removes a simple `.hide` class to show/hide the modal and overlay.

All done without any external libraries â€” pure JavaScript.
